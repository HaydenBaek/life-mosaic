          Life can be overwhelming. Between school, responsibilities, and the uncertainty of the future, it is easy to feel lost or unmotivated. 
          I built LifeMosaic as a way to bring clarity and purpose to those moments. By visualizing the future you want and breaking it down into meaningful steps, 
          LifeMosaic helps turn dreams into reality. This is not just a place to track accomplishments. It is a reminder that progress, no matter how small, is always worth celebrating.
